# 376. Wiggle Subsequence

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/" %}

A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

* For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a **wiggle sequence**because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` alternate between positive and negative.
* In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

A **subsequence** is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest **wiggle subsequence** of_ `nums`.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
</strong><strong>Output: 6
</strong><strong>Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
</strong><strong>Output: 7
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
</strong>One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).
</code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

Method 1: Greedy?&#x20;

```python
class Solution:
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return len(nums)
        preDiff = 0
        curDiff = 0
        result = 1
        for i in range(0, len(nums)-1):
            curDiff = nums[i+1] - nums[i]
            if (preDiff <= 0 and curDiff > 0) or (preDiff >= 0 and curDiff < 0):
                result += 1
                preDiff = curDiff

        return result
```
