# 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/" %}

You are given an array of people, `people`, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each `people[i] = [hi, ki]` represents the `ith` person of height `hi` with **exactly** `ki`other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to `hi`.

Reconstruct and return _the queue that is represented by the input array_ `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where `queue[j] = [hj, kj]` is the attributes of the `jth` person in the queue (`queue[0]` is the person at the front of the queue).

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
</strong><strong>Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
</strong><strong>Explanation:
</strong>Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
</strong><strong>Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= people.length <= 2000`
* `0 <= hi <= 106`
* `0 <= ki < people.length`
* It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def reconstructQueue(self, people: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not people:
            return people
        people.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0],x[1]))
        result = []
        for p in people:
            result.insert(p[1],p)
        return result
```

## Take away

1. use of `key=lambda x:` in sort()

Take a look at this Example, you will understand:

**Example 1:**

```python
a = input()
a = sorted(a, key = lambda x:(len(x),x))
print(a)
```

input: `["tim", "bob", "anna", "steve", "john","aaaa"]`\
output: `['bob', 'tim', 'aaaa', 'anna', 'john', 'steve']`

input: `["tim", "bob", "anna", "steve", "john","aaaaa"]`\
output: `['bob', 'tim', 'anna', 'john', 'aaaaa', 'steve']`

***

**Example 2 (advanced):**

```python
a = ["tim", "bob", "anna", "steve", "john","aaaaa","zzza"]
a = sorted(a, key = lambda x:(x[-1],len(x),x))
print(a)
```

output: `['anna', 'zzza', 'aaaaa', 'bob', 'steve', 'tim', 'john']`

***

**Example 3 (advanced):**

```python
a = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,1],[1,6],[3,8],[4,9],[0,3],[2,6],[9,5]]
a = sorted(a, key = lambda x:(-x[1],x[0]))
print(a)
```

output: `[[4, 9], [3, 8], [1, 6], [2, 6], [2, 5], [9, 5], [1, 4], [0, 3], [3, 1]]`

***

**Conclusion:**

`key = lambda x:(p1,p2,p3,p4,...,pn)`,\
`x` is one element at a time from the stream of input.\
`p1,p2,p3...pn` being properties based on which the stream of elements needs to be sorted.\
based on priority order of `p1>p2>p3>...>pn`.\
We can also add reverse=True, after the sorting condition, to sort the elements in reverse order.

2. use of `insert(index, element)` :&#x20;

#### Example[Get your own Python Server](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/)

Insert the value "orange" as the second element of the `fruit` list:

fruits = \['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\
\
fruits.insert(1, "orange")
