# 968. Binary Tree Cameras

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/" %}

You are given the `root` of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return _the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong><strong>Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong><strong>Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
* `Node.val == 0`
