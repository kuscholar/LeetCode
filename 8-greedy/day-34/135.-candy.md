# 135. Candy

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/" %}

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

* Each child must have at least one candy.
* Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
</strong><strong>Output: 5
</strong><strong>Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
</strong>The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
</code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `n == ratings.length`
* `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
* `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`
