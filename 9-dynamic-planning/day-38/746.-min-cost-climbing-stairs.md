# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/" %}

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith`step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return _the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor_.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: cost = [10,15,20]
</strong><strong>Output: 15
</strong><strong>Explanation: You will start at index 1.
</strong>- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 6
</strong><strong>Explanation: You will start at index 0.
</strong>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.
</code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        # 1. dp array: cost to reach top, index: min cost to reach ith floor
        # 2. function: dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + cost[i]
        # 3. init: dp[0] = cost[0], dp[1] = cost[1]
        # 4. order: left to right
        # 5. eg: [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]: 1, 100, 2, 3, 3, 103, 4, 5, 104, 6
        if len(cost) <= 2:
            return min(cost)
        dp = [0] * len(cost)
        dp[0] = cost[0]
        dp[1] = cost[1]
        for i in range(len(cost)):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + cost[i]
        return min(dp[-1], dp[-2])
```
