# 70. Climbing Stairs

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/" %}

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 2
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
</strong>1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 3
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
</strong>1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
</code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 45`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        # 1. dp array: ways to step up, index: ways to climb to ith floor
        # 2. function: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] (i >= 1)
        # 3. init: dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 2
        # 4. order: left to right
        # 5. eg: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
        # rationale: to get to dp[i], you can either step one more step of 2 stairs from each of the way of dp[i-2], or step two more steps of 1 stair from each of the way of dp[i-1]
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 2
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-2] + dp[i-1]
        return dp[n]
```

Rationale: to get to dp\[i], you can either step one more step of 2 stairs from each of the way of dp\[i-2], or step two more steps of 1 stair from each of the way of dp\[i-1]
