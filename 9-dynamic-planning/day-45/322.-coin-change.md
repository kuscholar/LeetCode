# 322. Coin Change

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/" %}

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
</strong><strong>Output: -1
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
</strong><strong>Output: 0
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
* `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
* `0 <= amount <= 104`
