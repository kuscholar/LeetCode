# 63. Unique Paths II

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/" %}

You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle.

Return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong><strong>Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
</strong>There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot2.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `m == obstacleGrid.length`
* `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # 1. dp array: ways to reach current position, index: number of unique ways to reach dp[i][j]
        # 2. function: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
        # 3. init: dp[[0]*n]*m --> all is 0 at first, except dp[0][0]=1, because it's possible that obstacle blocks ways
        # 4. order: left to right, top to down
        # 5. eg: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]], [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,2]]
        if obstacleGrid[-1][-1] == 1 or obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1:
            return 0
        dp = [[0]*len(obstacleGrid[0])]*len(obstacleGrid)
        dp[0][0] = 1
        for row in range(len(obstacleGrid)):
            for col in range(len(obstacleGrid[0])):
                if row == col == 0:
                    continue
                if obstacleGrid[row][col] == 1:
                    dp[row][col] = 0
                    continue
                if self.isValid(obstacleGrid, row-1, col):
                    top = dp[row-1][col]
                else:
                    top = 0
                if self.isValid(obstacleGrid, row, col-1):
                    left = dp[row][col-1]
                else:
                    left = 0
                dp[row][col] = top + left
        return dp[-1][-1]
    def isValid(self, obstacleGrid, row, col):
        return 0 <= row < len(obstacleGrid) and 0 <= col < len(obstacleGrid[0]) and obstacleGrid[row][col] == 0
```
