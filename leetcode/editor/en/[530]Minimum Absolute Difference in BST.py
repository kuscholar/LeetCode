# Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute 
# difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
# Output: 1
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
# Output: 1
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  0 <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ 
#
