# Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the 
# given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST. 
# 
#  Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages: 
# 
#  
#  Search for a node to remove. 
#  If the node is found, delete the node. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
# Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
# Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and 
# delete it.
# One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
# Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's 
# also accepted.
# 
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
# Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
# Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [], key = 0
# Output: []
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -10‚Åµ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ 
#  Each node has a unique value. 
#  root is a valid binary search tree. 
#  -10‚Åµ <= key <= 10‚Åµ 
#  
# 
#  
#  Follow up: Could you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?
