# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the 
# two numbers such that they add up to target. 
# 
#  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may 
# not use the same element twice. 
# 
#  You can return the answer in any order. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
# Output: [1,2]
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
# Output: [0,1]
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  2 <= nums.length <= 10⁴ 
#  -10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹ 
#  -10⁹ <= target <= 10⁹ 
#  Only one valid answer exists. 
#  
# 
#  
# Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than 
# O(n²) time complexity?
