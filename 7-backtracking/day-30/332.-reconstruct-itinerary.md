# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/" %}

You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

* For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary1-graph.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
</strong><strong>Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary2-graph.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
</strong><strong>Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
</strong><strong>Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= tickets.length <= 300`
* `tickets[i].length == 2`
* `fromi.length == 3`
* `toi.length == 3`
* `fromi` and `toi` consist of uppercase English letters.
* `fromi != toi`
