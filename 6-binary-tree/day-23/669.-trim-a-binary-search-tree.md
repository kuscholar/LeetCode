# 669. Trim a Binary Search Tree

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/" %}

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as `low` and `high`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[low, high]`. Trimming the tree should **not** change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a **unique answer**.

Return _the root of the trimmed binary search tree_. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
</strong><strong>Output: [1,null,2]
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/trim2.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3
</strong><strong>Output: [3,2,null,1]
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 104`
* The value of each node in the tree is **unique**.
* `root` is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
* `0 <= low <= high <= 104`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def trimBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], low: int, high: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # 1. parameter: root, low, high, return: TreeNode
        # 2. ending: None, out of range
        # 3. each level: trim
        if not root:
            return root
        # 分类讨论
        if root.val < low:
            # root.left is out of range too cuz it's BST
            return self.trimBST(root.right, low, high)
        if root.val > high:
            # root.right is out of range
            return self.trimBST(root.left, low, high)
        # now root.val is within the range
        root.left = self.trimBST(root.left, low, high)
        root.right = self.trimBST(root.right, low, high)
        return root
```
