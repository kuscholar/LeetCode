# 450. Delete Node in a BST

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/" %}

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return _the **root node reference** (possibly updated) of the BST_.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
</strong><strong>Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
</strong><strong>Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
</strong>One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
</strong><strong>Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
</strong><strong>Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [], key = 0
</strong><strong>Output: []
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
* `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
* Each node has a **unique** value.
* `root` is a valid binary search tree.
* `-105 <= key <= 105`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it with time complexity `O(height of tree)`?
